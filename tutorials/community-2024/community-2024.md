SAP Community is SAP's destination for all things community. Our community hosts multiple areas for partners and customers, primarily providing public content accessible to visitors. Originally launched in 2003 as the SAP Developer Network (SDN), the site has progressed over the years and is now simply known as SAP Community, delivering a wealth of knowledge about all aspects of SAP technology, services, and products.

### Set your display name


In order to participate fully in the SAP Community, you need to set your display name once you have registered via the SAP Universal ID process.

Your display name is what all other members can see when you post comments, ask questions, or write blog posts. The name should be professional, unique, and appropriate. For example if your name is "Sally Smith," you could use "sally.smith," "sallysmith," "sallys," "ssmith," or (perhaps your are lucky and no one has already claimed it) "sally."

Please do not use your login ID, email address, your company name, or a series of numbers or letters.


### Set your communications preferences


Notifications can let you know when something happens related to your published questions, blog posts, replies, comments, or around the topics you find interesting. The platform offers an extensive ability to fine-tune your notifications to meet your needs.

Now that you have yourself sorted, you are ready to start taking full advantage of the platform. There are a couple of things we recommend to start with that will help you familiarize yourself with the platform and topics.

Your first step whenever you come some place new is to introduce yourself. We just so happen to have the perfect place for that!

Once there you can choose to "join" the group.

Now that you have "joined" the group, you are able to contribute to the conversations within that particular group, so why not take a [quick moment](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/welcome-corner-blog-posts/welcome-all-sap-community-members-start-here/ba-p/5359) to say hello.  By taking this quick and easy step, you'll already receive a special thank you from the SAP Community.

We have a wide selection of groups to choose from. Feel free to explore and join others.

### Staying up to date

We have a dedicated space for new information related to the SAP Community, new groups being added, new features and functionalities, and so on. Your next quick step into the community is around your subscriptions.

Head over to the [What's New](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/what-s-new/bg-p/whats-new) area and there you will see **Options** on the right-hand side. Click that and select **Subscribe**.

### Knowing when the next events are happening

We have a dedicated section allowing you to **subscribe** to [events](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/events/ct-p/events). You can RSVP, comment, and even watch livestreams.

<!-- border -->![events](tutorial_tour_10.png)

Here you can view things in either a list view or a calendar view, filter, subscribe, and more.

### Asking Questions and Seeking Help

With a wealth of knowledge already available, our Q&A areas can provide you with the answers you need. If you can't find an answer though, you can simply ask your question directly.

<!-- border -->![questions](tutorial_tour_11.png)

Our blogging areas may also be the destination of choice for learning about topics and how others have been working with various products and technology. You can share your own knowledge here as well. For blogging, a special set of permissions is required -- so be sure to complete the [blogging tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/community-blogging.html) to get started.
